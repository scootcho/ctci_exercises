#Object-Oriented Design
---

Note - OOP design is fundamental to Ruby and Rails programming. Know this chapter BY HEART!! TODO Review chapter especially!!

remember design patterns! 

OOD (Object-Oriented Design) problems give or at least are believed to give an interviewer insight into your coding style.
they are about demonstrating that you understand how to create elegant, maintainable object-oriented code. Poor performance on this type of question may raise serious red flags
(OOD) questions are often intentionally vague in order to test whether you'll make assumptions or if you'll ask clarifying questions. 

#### How to Approach Object-Oriented Design Questions
Regardless of whether the object is a physical item or a technical task, object-oriented design questions can be tackled in similar ways:

Step 1: Handle Ambigulty
who is going to use it and how they are going to use it
you may even want to go through the "six Ws": who, what, where, when, how, why.
use cases can significantly impact the design.

Step 2: Define the Core Objects
For example, suppose we are asked to do the object-oriented design for a restaurant.
Our core objects might be things like Table, Guest, Party, Order, Meal, Employee, Server, and Host.

Step 3: Analyze Relationships
having decided on our core objects, we now want to analyze the relationships between the objects
Are relationships many-to-many or one-to-many?
talk to your interviewer about how general purpose your design should be.

For example, in the restaurant question, we may come up with the following design:
  • Party should have an array of Guests.
  • Server and Host inherit from Employee.
  • Each Table has one Party, but each Party may have multiple Tables.
  • There is one Host for the Restaurant.

Step 4: Investigate Actions
consider the key actions that the objects will take and how they relate to each other. You may find that you have forgotten some objects, and you will need to update your design.
Thngs to think about:
behaviors 
states

For example, a Party walks into the Restaurant, and a Guest requests a Table from the Host. The Host looks up the Reservation and, if it exists, assigns the Party to a Table. Otherwise, the Party is added to the end of the list. When a Party leaves, the Table isfreed and assignedto a new Party in the list.

#### Design Patterns
Because interviewers are trying to test your capabilities and not your knowledge, design patterns are mostly beyond the scope of an interview. However, the Singleton and FactoryMethod design patterns are especially useful for interviews, so we will cover them here.
There are far more design patterns than this book could possibly discuss. A fantastic way to improve your software engineering skills is to pick up a book that focuses on this area specifically.
