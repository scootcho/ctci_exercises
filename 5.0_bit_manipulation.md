# Bit Manipulation
---

Note: Since Bit Manipulation isn't that useful in a higher level and dynamic type language such as Ruby. It's important to know how things works rather than implementation of it.
It's useful to know to use AND and OR to get, set, clear, and update Bits.

#### Two’s Complement 
two's complement representation is the problem of storing negative integers.
Two complement values reserves the first digit for negative/positive sign purpose. This means that 4 digits will be 3 bits plus the 1 digit in the beginning representing positive/nagative.

in Boolean algebra they denote the truth values false and true. E.g., 1 + 1 = 0

And (conjunction), denoted x∧y (sometimes x AND y or Kxy), satisfies x∧y = 1 if x = y = 1 and x∧y = 0 otherwise.
Or (disjunction), denoted x∨y (sometimes x OR y or Axy), satisfies x∨y = 0 if x = y = 0 and x∨y = 1 otherwise.
Not (negation), denoted ¬x (sometimes NOT x, Nx or !x), satisfies ¬x = 0 if x = 1 and ¬x = 1 if x = 0.

#### Operator  Symbol  Form  Operation
left shift  <<  x << y  all bits in x shifted left y bits
right shift >>  x >> y  all bits in x shifted right y bits
bitwise NOT ~ ~x  all bits in x flipped
bitwise AND & x & y each bit in x AND each bit in y
bitwise OR  | x | y each bit in x OR each bit in y
bitwise XOR ^ x ^ y each bit in x XOR each bit in y

Note:
NOT or negation - converts 0 => 1 and 1 => 0 ( ~0010 = 1101 )

XOR - outputs true only when both inputs differ  ( 1 ^ 1 = 0 )

example: 
```
irb>> "%07b" % 3  #create 7 digit binary string
=> "0000011"
irb> 0b1101 #prefix with 0b for binary
=> 13
irb> x = 123
=> 123
irb> x.to_s(2)
=> "1111011"
irb> shift = 1 << 5
=> 32
irb> shift.to_s(2)
=> "100000"
irb> xor = 001^100
=> 101
irb> a = 18
=> 18
irb> b = ~a
=> -19
irb> 5.downto(0).map { |n| a[n] }.join
=> "010010"
irb> 5.downto(0).map { |n| b[n] }.join
=> "101101"
```
