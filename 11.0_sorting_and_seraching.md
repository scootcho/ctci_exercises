# Sorting and Searching
---

Understanding the common sorting and searching algorithms is incredibly valuable, as many of sorting and searching problems are tweaks of the well-known algorithms.

A good approach is therefore to run through the different sorting algorithms and see if one applies particularly well.

Example:
Given a very large array of Person objects, sort the people in increasing order of age.

Two interesting bits of knowledge here:
1. It's a large array, so efficiency is very important.
2. Wearesortingbasedonages,soweknowthevaluesareinasmallrange.
By scanning through the various sorting algorithms, we might notice that bucket sort (or radix sort) would be a perfect candidate for this algorithm. In fact, we can make the buckets small (just 1year each) and getO(n) running time.


#### Common Sorting Algorithms
For algorithm visualizations see:

Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Bucket Sort are the most commonly used in interviews.

**Bubble Sort** - Runtime: O(n^2) average and worst case. Memory:O(1).
In bubble sort, we start at the beginning of the array and swap the first two elements if the first is greater than the second. Then, we go to the next pair, and so on, continuously making sweeps of the array until it is sorted.

**Selection Sort** - Runtime: O(n^2) average and worst case. Memory: O(1).
Selection sort is the child's algorithm: simple, but inefficient. Find the smallest element using a linear scan and move it to the front (swapping it with the front element). Then, find the second smallest and move it, again doing a linear scan. Continue doing this until all the elements are in place.

**Merge Sort** - Runtime: O(n Log(n)) average and worst case. Memory: Depends.
Merge sort divides the array in half, sorts each of those halves, and then merges them back together. Each of those halves has the same sorting algorithm applied to it. Eventually, you are merging just two single-element arrays. It is the "merge" part that does all the heavy lifting.
The merge method operates by copying all the elements from the target array segment into a helper array, keeping track of where the start of the left and right halves should be (helperLeft and helperRight). We then iterate through helper, copying the smaller element from each half into the array. At the end, we copy any remaining elements into the target array

**Quick Sort** - Runtime: O(n Log(n)) average, O(n^2) worst case. Memory: O( Log (n) ).
In quick sort, we pick a random element and partition the array, such that all numbers that are less than the partitioning element come before all elements that are greater than it. The partitioning can be performed efficiently through a series of swaps (see below).

**Radix Sort** - Runtime: O(kn) (see below)
Radix sort is a sorting algorithm for integers (and some other data types) that takes advantage of the fact that integers have a finite number of bits. In radix sort, we iterate through each digit of the number, grouping numbers by each digit. For example, if we have an array of integers, we might first sort by the first digit, so that the Os are grouped together. Then, we sort each of these groupings by the next digit. We repeat this process sorting by each subsequentdigit, until finally the whole array issorted.

Unlike comparison sorting algorithms, which cannot perform better than 0(n log(n)) in the average case, radix sort has a runtime of 0( kn), where n is the number of elements and k is the number of passes of the sorting algorithm.


#### Searching Algorithms
When we think of searching algorithms, we generally think of binary search. This is a very useful algorithm to study.

In binary search, we look for an element x in a sorted array by first comparing x to the midpoint of the array. If x is less than the midpoint, then we search the left half of the array. If x is greater than the midpoint, then we search the right half of the array. We then repeat this process, treating the left and right halves as subarrays

search for a node by leveraging a binary tree, or by using a hash table. Think beyond binary search!
