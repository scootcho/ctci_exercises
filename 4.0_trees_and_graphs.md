# Trees and Graphs
---

Search is much harder in Trees & Graphs compared to linear Data Structures like Arrays & Lists.

Additionally, the worst case and average case time may vary wildly, and we must evaluate both aspects of any algorithm. Fluency in implementing a tree or graph from scratch will prove essential.

#### Potential Issues to Watch Out For
Trees and graphs questions are ripe for ambiguous details and incorrect assumptions. Be sure to watch out for the following issues and seek clarification when necessary.

#### Binary Tree vs. Binary Search Tree
When given a binary tree question, many candidates assume that the interviewer means binary search tree. Be sure to ask whether or not the tree is a binary search tree.
A binary search tree imposes the condition that, for all nodes, the left children are less than or equal to the current node, which is less than all the right nodes.

#### Balanced vs. Unbalanced
Ask if the tree is balanced or no. If the tree is unbalanced, you should describe your algorithm in terms of both the average and the worst case time.

#### Full and Complete
Full and complete trees are trees in which all leaves are at the bottom of the tree, and all non-leaf nodes have exactly two children. Note that full and complete trees are extremely rare, as a tree must have exactly 2n - 1 nodes to meet this condition.

#### Binary Tree Traversal
Note that pre-order and other forms of tree traversal are a form of DFS.
There are three types of depth-first traversal: pre-order, in-order, and post-order
you should be comfortable implementing in-order, post-order, and pre-order traversal
https://linuxmeerkat.wordpress.com/2012/12/25/traversing-binary-trees/
The order of "inorder" is: left child -> parent -> right child
http://www.programcreek.com/2012/12/leetcode-solution-of-binary-tree-inorder-traversal-in-java/
The order of "Postorder" is: left child -> right child -> parent node.

Preorder binary tree traversal is a classic interview problem about trees.

### Check if Binary Tree is Balanced
http://algorithms.tutorialhorizon.com/find-whether-if-a-given-binary-tree-is-balanced/

Recursion: Post order traversal technique

1. Travel all the way down to leaf nodes and then go up.
2. while going up, calculate the left and right sub­tree height.
3. If the difference between them is greater than 1, return –1.
4. Else Max(leftHeight, rightHeight) +1 .
5. Here you wont actually calculate the height of the sub­trees by calling function, instead you will store the height at each level and when you go one level up, you add one to it.

#### Tree Balancing: Red-Black Trees and AVL Tree
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree AVL = self balancing binary search tree. 


#### Heap
In a heap, the highest (or lowest) priority element is always stored at the root, hence the name heap

#### Trie (prefix tree )
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie


#### Graphs
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphVertex.html

#### Directed Graph (Digraph)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph
set of vertices (nodes/points) connected by edges (directed lines/directed arrows/directed archs), where the edges have a direction associated with them. In formal terms, a directed graph is an ordered pair 

Undirected graph - a graph in which the connecting lines don't have arrows; two nodes are either connected or they are not.
Digraph - a graph that have "one-way streets;" just because node x is connected to node y doesn't mean that the reverse is true.
A self-loop - is an edge that connects a vertex to itself.
Outdegree - the outdegree of a vertex is the number of edges pointing from it.
Indegree - of a vertex is the number of edges pointing to it.
A node - is also commonly called a vertex.
Weight - a weighted graph has connections (or edges) that have weights associated with them; these weights may express, for instance, the "distance" between two nodes.


#### Undirected Graph
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics)#Undirected_graph
similar to directed graph but the edges doesn't have directions

#### Directed vs Undirected
http://think-like-a-git.net/sections/graph-theory/directed-versus-undirected-graphs.html
directed/undirected simply means whether the edges in a graph are bidirectional or not.

#### Graph Traversal
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_traversal
Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS)

#### DFS

#### BFS
BFS is considerably less intuitive, and most interviewees struggle with it unless they are already familiar with the implementation.

#### The Adjacency Matrix
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AdjacencyMatrix.html
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix
a square matrix used to represent a finite graph. The elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in the graph.
Let’s say we have a graph with (V) nodes. We represent that graph with a (V x V) matrix full of 1’s and 0’s. If there exists an edge going from node [i] to node [j], then we place a (1) in row (i) and row (j). If there’s no such edge, then we place a (0) in row (i) and row (j). An adjacency list is another way to represent a graph. For each node (i), we setup lists that contain references to the nodes that (i) has an edge to.
If you have a dense graph and are doing lots of existence checking of edges, use an adjacency matrix.

#### Adjancey List
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AdjacencyList.html
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list
http://www.sitepoint.com/graph-algorithms-ruby/
if you have a sparse graph (i.e. lots of nodes, few edges), use an adjacency list. 

### Adjancency Matrix vs Adjacency List
It depends on the problem.
An adjacency matrix uses O(n*n) memory. It has fast lookups to check for presence or absence of a specific edge, but slow to iterate over all edges.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2218322/what-is-better-adjacency-lists-or-adjacency-matrices-for-graph-problems-in-c
Adjacency lists use memory in proportion to the number edges, which might save a lot of memory if the adjacency matrix is sparse. It is fast to iterate over all edges, but finding the presence or absence specific edge is slightly slower than with the matrix.

#### How to track the edges of a Graph
In order to build the algorithm, we need some way to keep track of what node to backtrack to when the time comes. To facilitate this, we use a data structure called a “stack”.
