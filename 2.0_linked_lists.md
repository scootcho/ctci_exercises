# Linked Lists
---

Linked list problems rely so much on the fundamental concepts, so it is essential that you can implement a linked list from scratch.

#### Implement a linked list
When you're discussing a linked list, you must understand whether it is a singly linked list or a doubly linked list.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list#Doubly_linked_vs._singly_linked

* singly - each node points to the next node.
* doubly - each node points to next and previous node.

```ruby
# CTCI implemented this as a node but for clarification's sake we'll call it an element instead
class Element 
  attr_accessor :data, :next, :prev

  def initialize(data)
    @data = data
    @next = nil
  end
end

class SinglyLinkedList
  attr_accessor :head, :tail

  # Element = Struct.new(:data, :next, :prev) #alternatively we can also use Struct here

  def initialize(data)
    @head = Element.new(data) #we can actually use a Struct here instead of creating an Element class
    @head.next = nil
    @tail = @head
  end

  def add(data)
    @tail.next = Element.new(data)
    @tail = @tail.next
    @tail.next = nil
  end

  def delete(data) #need to specify the data of the node to be deleted
    if @head.data == data
      @head = @head.next
    else
      previous = @head
      current = @head.next
      unless current.next == nil
        if current.data == data
          previous.next = current.next
        else
          previous = current
        end
      end
    end
  end

end
```

#### Deleting a Node from a Singly Linked List
* Singly Linked List - Given a node n, we find the previous node - node.prev and set node.prev.next equal to node.next

* Doubly Linked List - Given a node n, we find the previous node - node.prev and set node.prev.next equal to node.next; in addition, update next node - node.next to set node.next.prev equal to node.prev

The important things to remember:

1. to check for the null pointer.
2. to update the head or tail pointer as necessary.
3. if you are implementing this code in C, C++ or another language that requires the developer to do memory management, you should consider if the removed node should be deallocated.


#### The ‚ÄùRunner" Technique (or second pointer) technique is used in many linked list problems
have one pointer p1(the fast pointer) move every two elements for everyone move that p2 makes. When pi hits the end of the linked list, p2 will be at the midpoint. Then, move pi back to the front and begin "weaving" the elements. On each iteration, p2 selects an element and inserts it after p1.

#### Recursive Problems
A number of linked list problems rely on recursion
Remember:
* recursive algorithms take at least O(n) space, where n is the depth of the recursive call.
* All recursive algorithms can be implemented iteratively, although they may be much more complex.

#### Pattern Matching
is the act of checking a given sequence of tokens for the presence of the constituents of some pattern. In contrast to pattern recognition, the match usually has to be exact. 

### Framework
# 1. Resolve ambiguity
# 2. Design an Algorithm.
# 3. Write pseudocode first, before "real" code.
# 4. Write your code at a moderate pace.
# 5. Test your code and carefully fix any mistakes.
