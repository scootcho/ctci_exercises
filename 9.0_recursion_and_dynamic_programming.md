#### Recursion vs Iteration
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19794739/what-is-the-difference-between-iteration-and-recursion

Iterative Algorithms = Faster Performance but hard to write (sometimes hard to read too)

Recursive Algorithms = Faster to write but worse performance wise (Sometimes easier to understand too)

Recursion is rarely the most efficient approach to solving a problem, and iteration is almost always more efficient. This is because there is usually more overhead associated with making recursive calls...

#### Sets
Definition (Equality of sets): Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements. 
Thus for example {1, 2, 3} = {3, 2, 1}

While there is a wide variety of recursive problems, many follow similar patterns. A good hint that a problem is recursive is that it can be built off of sub-problems.

Recursion termination occurs provided you have a base case that is reachable from any set of initial conditions. In your case, "return 1 if n == 0" is your base case. The answer is 1 for n == 0, and the problem tends to 0, so you are OK.

A recursive method is a method that calls itself from within its own method definition. Much like a loop, it needs to have a way to break out of itself, as well as some sort of incrementor to prevent infinite looping. The break is referred to as a “base case” and will return out of the method if evaluated to true.

When you hear a problem beginning with the following statements, it's often (though not always) a good candidate for recursion: "Design an algorithm to compute the nth ,.." ; "Write code to list the first n...";"Implement a method to compute all..."; etc..

When you hear "n-th" try to grasp if it's recursive problem.

#### How to Approach
Most of the time, it's creating a function then adding something, removing something
E.g., f(n) => f(n-1)

bottom-up and top-down recursive solutions.
The Base Case and Build approach works quite well for recursive problems.

### Bottom-Up Recursion
usually more intuitive, solve for simple case then the next one
The key here is to think about how you can build the solution for one case off of the previous case.

### Top-Down Recursion
usually more complex
In these problems, we think about how we can divide the problem for case N into sub-problems. Be careful of overlap between the cases.

#### Dynamic Programming
rarely asked
If get a DP problem, you can approach it much the same way as a recursion problem. The difference is that intermediate results are "cached" for future calls.
A good way to approach such a problem is often to implement it as a normal recursive solution, and then to add the caching part.

#### Fibonacci example:
Find the Fiboonaci number at fib = [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,...], fibonacci(6) = 8

regular fibonacci is O(2^n)
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12178642/fibonacci-sequence-in-ruby-recursion
```
def fibonacci( n )
  if n == 0 || n == 1
    return n
  end
  fibonacci( n - 1 ) + fibonacci( n - 2 )
end 
```

with caching is O(n)
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24438655/ruby-fibonacci-algorithm
```
def fibonacci_cache(n, cache = {})
  if n == 0 || n == 1
    return n
  end
  cache[n] ||= fibonacci_cache(n-1, cache) + fibonacci_cache(n-2, cache)
end
```
Sample Output:
```
fibonacci 24
=> 46368
fib 124
=> 36726740705505779255899443

#Benchmark

Dynamic programming, as you can see, is little more than recursion where you cache the results. A good way to approach such a problem is often to implement it as a normal recursive solution, and then to add the caching part.

#### Recursive vs. Iterative Solutions
Recursive algorithms can be very space inefficient. Each recursive call adds a new layer to the stack, which means that if your algorithm has O(n) recursive calls, then it uses O(n) memory.
All recursive code can be implemented iteratively, although sometimes the code to do so is much more complex. Before diving into recursive code, ask yourself how hard it would be to implement it iteratively, and discuss the trade-offs with your interviewer.

#### Recursion Explained:
http://www.programmerinterview.com/index.php/recursion/explanation-of-recursion/

*Base cases and Recursion*
In the base case, the routine does not call itself. But, when a routine does have to call itself in order to complete its sub-task, then that is known as the **recursive case**. So, there are 2 types of cases when using a recursive algorithm: **base cases** and **recursive cases**. 

*Call Stacks, Recursion, and Stack Frames*
A call stack is a data structure used by the program to store information about the active subroutines in a program. The main reason for having a call stack is so that the program can keep track of where a subroutine should return control to once it finishes executing.

*A call stack is composed of stack frames*
A stack frame is a part of the call stack, and a new stack frame is created every time a subroutine is called... So, remember that a call stack is basically a stack of stack frames.

*Stack Frames in Recursion*
Lets suppose that we try to find the factorial of “3” using the function that we created above (so “x” is equal to 3), this is what the stack frames would look like:
![stack frames](http://www.programmerinterview.com/images/stack.png)


You can see that the first stack frame is created with x equal to 3. And then a call to Factorial(2) is made – so the first call to “Factorial(3)” does not run to completion because another call (Factorial(2)) is made before the very first call to Factorial can run to completion. A stack frame is used to “hold” the “state” of the first call to Factorial – it will store the local function variables (and their values) of the current invocation of Factorial, and it will also store the return address of the method that called it (since we are talking about the very first non-recursive invocation of Factorial, whatever routine invoked Factorial in the first place is where Factorial would return when it is completely done with everything) . Because the stack frame also stores the return address, the Factorial function knows where to return to when it finishes running.

Finally, in the 3rd stack frame, we run into our base case, which means the recursive calls are finished and then control is returned to the 2nd stack frame, where Factorial(1) * 2 is calculated to be 2, and then control is returned to the very first stack frame. Finally, our result of “6” is returned.


*Without a base case in recursion the stack overflows*
Every new stack frame created needs more memory, which then means that there is less memory on the call stack. The call stack has limited memory, which is usually determined at the start of the program – and when that limited memory is exceeded then the stack is said to overflow, which will usually result in the program crashing
