# Threads and Locks
---

### Muti-threading
PRO:
Can execute multiple simultaneously

CON:
Race Conditions: possible problems that might occur from concurrency to corrupt data. (this happens when doing recursion or when an input is dependent on another executionâ€™s output and so on.

#### Synchronized Methods:
It can be applied to methods and code blocks, and restricts multiple threads from executing the code simultaneously on the same object.
"If they have the same instance of MyObject, then no. But,if they hold different references, then the answer is yes."

Mutex in Ruby is similar to Synchronize keyword in Java
http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Mutex.html

```ruby
require 'thread'
semaphore = Mutex.new

a = Thread.new {
  semaphore.synchronize {
    # access shared resource
  }
}

b = Thread.new {
  semaphore.synchronize {
    # access shared resource
  }
}
```



Locks:
at most one thread can hold the lockand, therefore, only one thread can access the shared resource.


Deadlocks:

Know how to implement an algorithm with threads!

Threads in Java
Every thread in Java is createdand controlled by a unique object of the java.lang. Thread class. When a standalone application is run, a user thread is automatically created to execute the main() method. This thread is called the main thread.

Hence we always see the line:
  `public static void main(String [] args)`

#### Forking vs Threading
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16354460/forking-vs-threading
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2483041/what-is-the-difference-between-fork-and-thread

A fork gives you a brand new process, which is a copy of the current process, with the same code segments.
A thread is another execution thread of the same task. One task can have multiple threads, and the task memory object are shared among threads, therefore shared data must be accessed through some primitive and synchronization objects (like mutexes, condition variables and semaphores) that allow you to avoid data corruption.



```

def calculate_sum(arr)
  sleep(2)
  sum = 0
  arr.each do |item|
    sum += item
  end
  sum
end

@items1 = [12, 34, 55]
@items2 = [45, 90, 2]
@items3 = [99, 22, 31]

threads = (1..3).map do |i|
  Thread.new(i) do |i|
    items = instance_variable_get("@items#{i}")
    puts "items#{i} = #{calculate_sum(items)}"
  end
end

threads.each {|t| t.join}

```

#### Deadlocks and Deadlock Prevention
In order for a deadlock to occur, you must have all four of the following conditions met:
1. Mutual Exclusion: Only one process can access a resource at a given time. (Or, more accurately, there is limited access to a resource. A deadlock could also occur if a resource has limited quantity.)
2. Hold and Wait: Processes already holding a resource can request additional resources, without relinquishing their current resources.
3. No Preemption: One process cannot forcibly remove another process' resource.
4. Circular Wait: Two or more processes form a circular chain where each process is waiting on another resource in the chain.
